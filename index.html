                   A fun website that turns photos into cross stitch patterns. My wife uses it and she's a regular user, so that's definitely a win. Learned webgl to speed it up.

                    Whatado was a social network for people to make connections based on activities. You would post what youâ€™re planning to do, others in the area would see it and ask to join. I'm happy with how it turned out - it performed and looked great.<br>

                <div class="project-description">
                    In college I created a Django website, followed by a React Native app to host treasure hunts. I built treasure chests and hid them around the city with QR codes and candy. Using the site/app you get your clue which leads you to the chest where you'll scan the code to get the next clue. Gave out thousands of $ in prizes.

                    I ended up creating my own app that saved csv files of spending data into iCloud. I wrote a few custom python scripts to analyze and visualize the data from my laptop.
